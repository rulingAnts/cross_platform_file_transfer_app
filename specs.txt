I want to build a very rapid file transfer app. It should run on Android, Windows, and Mac, broadcast its existence, recognize other clients of the same app, and have a password set on each client (that the user can edit). In order to send or receive from the other device, they need to enter the password set for the other device, but not the IP address, they should just detect other instances of that app on the same local network. It should work by allowing the user to drag and drop (desktop verson) onto the app (after selecting one or more target devices), each of those devices need to confirm receipt (actually forget the password, have it show a number on both screens like bluetooth pairing or Microsoft authenticator). The user can keep dropping files and adding clients. It should support multiple connections (as many as possible, like Free Download Manager) in order to maximize transfer speed (and using whatever network protocol works well with that).
